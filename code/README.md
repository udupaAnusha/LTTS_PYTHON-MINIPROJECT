# Detail description of the Project

### How it works?
* The first main page is where you get the start button to start the game
* On clicking the start button it takes you to the page where there are options to choose on what category the player can choose for.
* The categories include animals, body parts, colors, fruits, shapes, vegetables and vehicles.
* Now on choosing the category the game begins; on every correct answer you get 5 points.
* In case if you cannot recognize the word, then there is an option to change the word.
* There is also an option to view the answer, on clicking that you will get the answer by minus-ing the total score by 5 points.
